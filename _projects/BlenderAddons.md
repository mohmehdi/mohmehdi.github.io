***Designing and implementation of:***  
Some blender addons(plugin) to learn about blender api  

***Better timeline for animation:***    
I made a tiny adjustment to the timeline to make checking the looped animations easier  

***Screenshot to Scene***  
As a TA I used blender as a whiteboard program since it has lots of tools in my classes so I made this addon to make adding images from clipboard easy  
{% include gallery caption="Blender Addons" %}
