***Designing and implementation of:***  
Addons (plugins) for learning blender API  

***Better timeline for animation:***    
In order to simplify checking looped animations, I altered the timeline so that moving to the next frame follows the timeline start and end frames, so for instance, being at the last frame moves to the start.  

***Screenshot to Scene***   
During covid In my classes, I used Blender as a whiteboard program because it has a lot of features, so I made this add-on to make it easier to add images from the clipboard  
{% include gallery caption="Blender Addons" %}
