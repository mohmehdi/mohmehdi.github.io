***Designing and implementation of:***  
- BFS, DFS, IDS, UCS (Uninformed Search Strategies)
- 8 Puzzle solver using A* & IDA (Informed Heuristic Search Strategies)
- genetic algorithms, simulated annealing (Local Search)
- Min-Max, Alphaâ€“Beta (Adversarial Search)
- classification of a dataset (Basic Machine Learning)
- knowledge representation using prolog (knowledge-based system)

***Puzzle 8***
An IDA* and A* approach to solving puzzle 8 for the course on artificial intelligence     
{% include gallery caption="Puzzle 8" %}

Puzzle 8 is a classic problem with a relatively large space to search for the solution  
This project was a great way to practice optimizing search algorithms
