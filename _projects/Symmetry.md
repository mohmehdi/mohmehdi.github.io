***Designing and implementation of:***  
A game to test our short-term memory for visual information  
At first, I designed this project as a teaching tool for elementary students to teach them about symmetry then I decided to add some more difficult levels 
{% include gallery caption="Symmetry" %}

The game also consist of a creative level to draw the main sample and then it is playable in the creative mode  

***This is the last level***
