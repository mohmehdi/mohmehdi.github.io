### What are automatas    
in simple terms they are abstract machines that takes an input consist of symbols then change the **state** of the machine with in that symbol to another state based on some **transition** rules  

### Why automatas  
[wiki] Automata play a major role in the theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification.    

most students learn about automatas to understand compilers, but, since they have a wide variety of applications, I thought making it a puzzle game might make learning them more fun. the game is still a prototype but the main functionality is there and can be used as a learning tool.
