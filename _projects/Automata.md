### What is an automata    
It is essentially an abstract machine that takes an input consisting of symbols and changes its **state** according to some **transition** rules

 

### Why automatas  
[wiki] Automata play a major role in the theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification.    

Since automata have a wide range of applications, I decided to make them into a puzzle game so that learning them would be more fun. Despite being a prototype, the game's main functionality is present and can be used as a teaching tool.
