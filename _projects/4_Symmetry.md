***Designing and implementation of:***  
A game to test our short-term memory for visual information  
In the beginning, I designed this project to teach elementary students about symmetry, but then I added some more challenging levels  
{% include gallery caption="Symmetry" %}

There is also a creative level to draw the main sample, and then the game is playable in creative mode   

***This is the last level***
