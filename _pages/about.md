I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan. Besides my role as a research assistant, I've taken up teaching assistant responsibilities on several occasions. My interests span various domains within computer science, with a strong focus on generative AI. Beyond academics, I also create games as an independent developer and co-founded Null-references, a team committed to bringing the game "Uncertainty" to life. Simultaneously, I'm actively contributing as a research assistant.

In the future, I'm enthusiastic about pursuing further education to continue advancing my career.
